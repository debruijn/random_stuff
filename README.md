# random-stuff

This is my repository for doing random stuff: something I quickly want to test out, simulate, etc. 
I normally often create "scratch files" for these but I'd like to start committing them instead. This way,
I can access them easier from other devices, and I can potentially share this out easier.

## Current contents
(Knowing me, this might start getting outdated occasionally)
- simulate_swiss: a script to show how you could potentially organize a 24 team 4 win or 5 win Swiss tournament. 
Motivation: in current Counterstrike setup for the Major tournaments, 24 teams do a 16 team 3 win Swiss tournament, 
with 8 teams skipping the first part, and I don't like teams skipping a stage.
- rendercv_makefile: the Makefile that I use to create different versions of my resume based on a single YAML, allowing 
for versions without my phone number and email. The YAML that I use is not provided, but the output is. :)
- find_caboose_numbers: a script to investigate Caboose numbers and graphically show them (see script for more info)
- divisible_by_7: a script to find remainders of dividing by 7 (or any other number) in a different way than usual

## General type of content to be expected
Going by memory of type of stuff I have done in the past and I'd like to put in here in the future:
- Simulation of probability that for two equally good Tennis players, the player with least points scored wins.
- Messing around with GUI utility packages, e.g. "Plot an interactive table using a TKinter competitor"
- Investigating mathematical properties after watching a Numberphile or Standupmaths video. For example, implementing 
Ludgate's Irish logarithm which uses a table to calculate the product of two integers using only addition.
- Testing some random online script - if I will include it in this repo I should include references of course.
- Experimenting with use cases of not-often used parts of standard Python like Defaultdict
